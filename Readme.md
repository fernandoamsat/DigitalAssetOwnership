# Digital Asset Registry

The Digital Asset Registry is a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to register ownership of digital assets such as artwork, music, or in-game items. This registry ensures the authenticity and uniqueness of each digital asset by recording ownership changes on the blockchain.

## Features

- Register digital assets by associating them with a unique asset ID and metadata.
- Transfer ownership of digital assets securely using blockchain transactions.
- Retrieve metadata of registered digital assets.

## Usage

### Registering a Digital Asset

To register a new digital asset, call the `registerAsset` function with the desired asset ID and metadata. Only the owner of the asset can register it.

```solidity
function registerAsset(uint256 assetId, string memory metadata) external;

Transferring Ownership
To transfer ownership of a digital asset to another address, call the transferAsset function with the asset ID and the new owner's address. Only the current owner of the asset can transfer ownership.

Retrieving Metadata
To retrieve the metadata of a registered digital asset, call the getAssetMetadata function with the asset ID.

function getAssetMetadata(uint256 assetId) external view returns (string memory);
